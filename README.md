# Modeling-and-Identification-of-a-Lithium-ion-Battery-using-Recursive-Least-Squares-approach

The article's main objective is to create, simulate, and assess the battery model's performance. 
•	To regulate the energy consumption of battery-powered devices, circuit designers must obtain precise battery information, including state-of-charge (SOC), current, and voltage. Otherwise they have no idea when to charge the battery to use it optimally in various application such as in electric vehicle as well as in other electrical device.
Additionally, handling the battery is essential to prevent overcharging or over discharging. As a result, a precise battery model is essential for use as a reference during the circuit design process to predict the characteristics of the battery. 
•	To build this model, we will make predictions about the battery's state space equivalent values, which, when paired with data on the battery's state of charge and current, will yield the model voltage for an input current.
•	In this paper, an equivalent circuit model is developed in Simulink. State-of-charge (SOC) and current allow circuit designers to adjust the battery model's characteristics in accordance with the behavior of the battery.
